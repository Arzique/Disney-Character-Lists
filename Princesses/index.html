    <p>
      <b>Moana Waialiki</b> of Motunui is the title character of the 2016 Walt
      Disney Animation Studios film Moana Created by directors Ron Clements and
      John Musker, Moana is voiced by Hawaiian actress and singer Auliʻi
      Cravalho. As a toddler, she is voiced by Louise Bush. Moana is set to
      return in the Disney+ sequel series Moana, which will premiere in 2024, as
      well as a live-action remake film, in 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by Polynesian mythology, Moana is depicted as the strong-willed
      daughter of a chief of a Polynesian village, who is chosen by the ocean
      itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a blight
      strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of Maui (Dwayne Johnson), a
      legendary demigod, in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and
      saving her people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moana received widespread critical acclaim for her independence as well as
      Cravalho for her vocal performance. By 2019, Moana was officially inducted
      into the Disney Princess line-up, becoming the twelfth member.

    <img

      alt="A picture of the Disney princess, Mulan"
    />

    <p>
      <b>Fa Mulan</b> is a fictional character, inspired by a legendary figure,
      who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' animated film Mulan (1998). Her
      speaking voice is provided by actress Ming-Na Wen, while singer Lea
      Salonga provides the character's singing voice. Created by author Robert
      D. San Souci, Mulan is based on the legendary Chinese warrior Hua Mulan
      from the poem the Ballad of Mulan, making her the first Disney Princess
      not to be based on a fairytale or folktale but rather a legend. The only
      child of an aging war veteran, Mulan disregards both tradition and the law
      by disguising herself as a man in order to enlist herself in the army in
      lieu of her feeble father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disney had originally conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman
      who ultimately elopes to Europe to be with a British prince. However,
      director Tony Bancroft, who was inspired by the well-being of his own
      daughters, wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind of Disney heroine –
      one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male
      character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was
      relegated to that of a minor subplot, while Mulan's bravery and strength
      were emphasized in order to ensure that she remained the hero of her own
      story. She became the eighth Disney Princess and the first one who isn't
      actually a princess in her film, as she wasn't born of royalty nor did she
      become one by marrying a prince. While an argument could be made that
      Pocahontas is still technically a princess since she is a chieftain's
      daughter, Mulan quite literally is not, but is included in the lineup
      nonetheless. She also became the first one of Asian descent as well. She
      is the last Disney Princess to be developed during the Disney Renaissance.
      Mulan's supervising animator was Mark Henn, who deliberately designed the
      character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reception towards Mulan's personality has been generally positive, with
      critics praising her bravery and heroism. However, her romantic
      relationship with Shang has been accused of compromising Mulan's
      heroism.Both Wen and Salonga have been awarded Disney Legends for their
      contributions to the role. Yifei Liu played the live-action version of the
      character in the 2020 live-action adaptation of the original 1998 film,
      named Hua Mulan.

    />

    <p>
      <b>Princess Leia Organa</b> is a fictional character and one of the main
      characters in the Star Wars franchise, portrayed by Carrie Fisher.
      Introduced in the original Star Wars film[b] in 1977, Leia is princess of
      the planet Alderaan, a member of the Imperial Senate and an agent of the
      Rebel Alliance. She thwarts the sinister Sith Lord Darth Vader and helps
      bring about the destruction of the Empire's cataclysmic superweapon, the
      Death Star. In The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Leia commands a Rebel base
      and evades Vader as she falls in love with the smuggler Han Solo. In
      Return of the Jedi (1983), Leia helps in the operation to rescue Han from
      the crime lord Jabba the Hutt and is revealed to be Vader's daughter and
      the twin sister of Luke Skywalker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prequel film Revenge of the Sith (2005) establishes that the twins'
      mother is Senator (and former queen) Padmé Amidala of Naboo, who dies
      after childbirth, while their father is Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who
      falls to the dark side of the Force and becomes the Sith lord Darth Vader.
      Leia is adopted by Senator Bail and Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan. In the
      sequel trilogy, Leia is a founder and General of the Resistance against
      the First Order. She and Han have a son named Ben Solo, who adopted the
      name Kylo Ren after turning to the dark side of the Force and became a
      warlord of the First Order. In The Rise of Skywalker (2019), it is
      revealed that Leia was briefly trained as a Jedi by her brother sometime
      after Return of the Jedi. In the film, Leia is the mentor of Rey, the last
      remaining Jedi. Leia dies towards the end of the film but returns in the
      epilogue scene as a Force ghost alongside Luke.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the more popular Star Wars characters, Leia has been called a 1980s
      icon, a feminist hero and model for other adventure heroines. She has
      appeared in many derivative works and merchandising, including the
      now-noncanonical Star Wars Expanded Universe, and has been referenced or
      parodied in several TV shows and films. Her 'cinnamon bun' hairstyle from
      Star Wars (1977) and metal bikini from Return of the Jedi have become
      cultural icons. Fisher was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress
      twice for A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. Fisher later received two
      Saturn Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress, the first for The
      Force Awakens and the second being a posthumous nomination for The Last
      Jedi.

      alt="A picture of the Disney princess, Rapunzel"
    />

    <p>
      <b>Rapunzel</b> is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney
      Animation Studios' animated film Tangled (2010). Voiced by American
      actress and singer Mandy Moore, Rapunzel is a young princess kept unaware
      of her royal heritage by a vain old woman named Mother Gothel, who raises
      her in a secluded tower to exploit her hair's healing abilities to remain
      young and beautiful forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Created and animated by supervising animator Glen Keane, Rapunzel is
      loosely based on the title character of the fairy tale of the same name
      published by the Brothers Grimm. The character was adapted into a less
      passive heroine for the film.
    </p>
    <p>
      Critical reception of Rapunzel has been generally positive, with critics
      complimenting her spirited, lively personality and independence. The tenth
      Disney Princess, Rapunzel was officially inducted into the line-up on
      October 2, 2011, becoming the franchise's first computer-animated member
      and the first European princess in 20 years, the last being Belle from
      Beauty and the Beast (1991). Her appearance and personality have drawn
      much comparison between her and one of the preceding Disney Princesses,
      Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), by whom she was inspired.

    <p>
      <b>Ariel</b> is a fictional character in Walt Disney Pictures' animated
      film The Little Mermaid (1989). Ariel is voiced by Jodi Benson in all
      official animated appearances. Ariel is the youngest daughter of King
      Triton and Queen Athena of an underwater kingdom of merfolk called
      Atlantica.[4][5] She is often rebellious, and in the first film, she longs
      to be a part of the human world. She marries Prince Eric, whom she rescued
      from a shipwreck, and together they have a daughter, Melody.[6] She is the
      fourth Disney Princess and also the first Disney Princess to be developed
      during the Disney Renaissance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character is based on the title character of Hans Christian Andersen's
      1837 fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" but was developed into a different
      personality for the 1989 animated film adaptation. Ariel has received a
      mixed reception from critics; some publications such as Time criticize her
      for being too devoted to Eric whereas others, such as Empire, praise the
      character for her rebellious personality, a departure from previous Disney
      Princesses' roles. Halle Bailey portrays a live-action version of the
      character in the 2023 live-action adaptation of the original 1989 film.

    <p>
      <b>Pocahontas</b> is the titular character of Walt Disney Pictures'
      animated film Pocahontas (1995), and the seventh addition to the Disney
      Princess franchise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character is loosely based on the actual historical figure Pocahontas
      (1596-1617), making her the first (and only) Disney Princess to be based
      on a real historical figure. As the daughter of a Native American
      Tsenacommacah-paramount chief of the Powhatan paramountcy, Pocahontas is
      the first American Disney Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pocahontas is voiced by Native American actress Irene Bedard in the 1995
      film, its 1998 sequel, and all related media. Bedard also served as one of
      the physical models for the character. Pocahontas' singing voice is
      performed by Broadway singer Judy Kuhn.

    <h2 id="belle">Belle</h2>
    <img
      src="images/Belle_disney.png"
      alt="A picture of the Disney princess, Belle"
    />

    <p>
      <b>Belle</b> is a fictional character in Walt Disney Pictures' animated
      film Beauty and the Beast (1991). Voiced by actress and singer Paige
      O'Hara, Belle, the book-loving daughter of an eccentric inventor, yearns
      to abandon her predictable village life in return for adventure. When her
      father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast in an enchanted
      castle, Belle offers her own freedom in exchange for her father's, and
      gradually learns to love the Beast despite his outward appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg commissioned Beauty and the Beast as an
      animated musical with a strong heroine, for which he hired first-time
      screenwriter Linda Woolverton. Basing her on the heroine of the 1740 fairy
      tale of the same name, Woolverton adapted Belle into a more proactive
      character for the film, deliberately conceiving her as a feminist to
      curtail criticisms Disney had long received for purportedly portraying
      female characters as victims. Inspired by the women's rights movement and
      actress Katharine Hepburn's performance in the film Little Women (1933),
      Woolverton created Belle as a unique departure from previous Disney
      heroines, particularly The Little Mermaid's Ariel. However, some story
      artists often contested Woolverton's liberated vision for the character.
      Animated by James Baxter and Mark Henn, the former of whom based the
      character's graceful gait on those of impressionist Edgar Degas'
      ballerinas, Belle's European facial features were inspired by those of
      British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn. Several additional
      Hollywood actresses inspired Belle's appearance, including Natalie Wood,
      Elizabeth Taylor, and Grace Kelly. Disney auditioned 500 candidates for
      the role, before casting O'Hara based on her mature-sounding voice and
      Broadway experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belle has garnered widespread acclaim from film critics who appreciated
      the character's bravery, intelligence, and independence. Reception towards
      her feminism, however, has been more mixed, with commentators accusing the
      character's actions of being romance-oriented. The fifth Disney Princess,
      Belle is often ranked among the franchise's best members. Highly regarded
      as one of Disney's strongest examples of a feminist character, critics
      agree that Belle helped spearhead a generation of independent film
      heroines while changing the reputation of a Disney princess. Also one of
      Disney's most iconic characters, Belle was the only animated heroine
      nominated for the American Film Institute's greatest heroes in film
      ranking. The character also appears in the film's several sequels and
      spin-offs, as well as her own live-action television series. American
      actress Susan Egan originated the role of Belle in the Broadway musical
      adaptation of the film, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award for
      Best Actress in a Musical. Emma Watson played Belle in the 2017
      live-action adaptation of the film.

    <p>
      <b>Tiana</b> is a fictional character in Walt Disney Pictures' animated
      film The Princess and the Frog (2009). Created by writers and directors
      Ron Clements and John Musker and animated by Mark Henn, Tiana, as an
      adult, is voiced by Anika Noni Rose, while Elizabeth M. Dampier voices the
      character as a child. She will appear in the Disney+ series Tiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is loosely based on two princesses: Princess Emma, the heroine of E.
      D. Baker's 2002 novel The Frog Princess, and the princess from the
      Brothers Grimm fairy tale "The Frog Prince", which inspired Baker's novel.
      The character also was inspired by famed New Orleans chef Leah Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tiana is depicted as a hardworking waitress who dreams of opening her own
      restaurant. She finds her progress stalled when she transforms into a frog
      after desperately kissing a prince who has been turned into one by an evil
      witch doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tiana has been mostly positively received with critics praising her
      personality and values. However, the depiction of Tiana and her community
      has been criticized for lacking "emphasis on racial issues".[1] The
      decision to depict the two main characters, Tiana and Naveen, as frogs for
      the majority of the film has also caused controversy, with some saying
      that it downplays the characters' identities.[2] She is the ninth
      character added to the Disney Princess franchise, and is known for being
      the first African American member in the franchise. She is also the most
      modern princess in the lineup, as her story takes place in 1920’s New
      Orleans.

    <h2 id="elsa">Elsa</h2>
    <img
      src="images/Elsa_Disney.png"
      alt="A picture of the Disney princess, Elsa"
    />

    <p>
      <b>Elsa</b> of Arendelle is a fictional character who appears in Walt
      Disney Animation Studios' computer-animated fantasy film Frozen (2013) and
      its sequel Frozen II (2019). She is voiced mainly by Idina Menzel, with
      Eva Bella as a young child and by Spencer Ganus as a teenager in Frozen.
      In Frozen II, young Elsa is voiced by Mattea Conforti (at the start of the
      film) and Eva Bella (archive audio).
    </p>
    <p>
      Created by co-writers and directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, Elsa is
      loosely based on the title character of "The Snow Queen", a Danish fairy
      tale by Hans Christian Andersen. In the Disney film adaptation, she is
      introduced as a princess in the fictional Scandinavian Kingdom of
      Arendelle, heiress to the throne and the elder sister of Anna (Kristen
      Bell). Elsa has the magical ability to create and manipulate ice and snow.
      She inadvertently sends Arendelle into an eternal winter on the evening of
      her coronation. Throughout the film, she struggles first with controlling
      and concealing her abilities and then with liberating herself from her
      fears of unintentionally harming others, especially her younger sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the original
      fairytale and villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved
      difficult to adapt to film due to her transparent depiction. Several film
      executives, including Walt Disney, attempted to build on the character,
      and a number of scheduled film adaptations were shelved when they could
      not work out the character. Buck and his co-director, Jennifer Lee, were
      ultimately able to solve the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as
      sisters. As much as Anna's struggle is external, Elsa's is internal. This
      led to Elsa being gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsa has received largely positive reception from reviewers, who praised
      her complex characterization and vulnerability. Menzel was also widely
      praised for her vocal performance of Elsa, especially that of her
      performance of the song "Let It Go".

    <h2 id="aurora">Aurora</h2>
    <img
      src="images/Aurora_(Sleeping_Beauty).png"
      alt="A picture of the Disney princess, Aurora"
    />

    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>, also known as Sleeping Beauty or Briar Rose, is a fictional
      character who appears in Walt Disney Productions' animated film Sleeping
      Beauty (1959). Originally voiced by singer Mary Costa, Aurora is the only
      child of King Stefan and Queen Leah. An evil fairy named Maleficent seeks
      revenge for not being invited to Aurora's christening and curses the
      newborn princess, foretelling that she will prick her finger on a spinning
      wheel's spindle and die before sunset on her sixteenth birthday.
      Merryweather, one of the three good fairies, weakened the curse so Aurora
      would only sleep. Determined to prevent this, three good fairies raise
      Aurora as a peasant in order to protect her, patiently awaiting her
      sixteenth birthday—the day the spell can only be broken by a kiss from her
      true love, Prince Phillip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aurora is based on the princess in Charles Perrault's fairy tale "Sleeping
      Beauty", as well as the heroine who appears in the Brothers Grimm's
      retelling of the story, "Little Briar Rose". For several years, Walt
      Disney had struggled to find a suitable actress to voice the princess and
      nearly abandoned the film entirely until Costa was discovered by composer
      Walter Schumann. However, Costa's southern accent nearly cost her the role
      until she proved that she could sustain a British accent for the duration
      of the film. In order to accommodate the film's unprecedentedly detailed
      backgrounds, Aurora's refined design demanded more effort than had ever
      been spent on an animated character before, with the animators drawing
      inspiration from Art Nouveau. Animated by Marc Davis, Aurora's slender
      physique was inspired by actress Audrey Hepburn. With only 18 lines of
      dialogue and equally few minutes of screen time, the character speaks less
      than any speaking main character in a feature-length Disney animated film.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sleeping Beauty was first released in 1959, the film was both a
      critical and commercial failure, discouraging the studio from adapting
      fairy tales into animated films for three decades. Aurora herself received
      negative reviews from both film and feminist critics for her passivity and
      similarities to Snow White, and would remain Disney's last princess until
      The Little Mermaid's Ariel debuted 30 years later in 1989. However,
      Costa's vocal performance was praised, which inspired her to pursue a
      full-time career as an opera singer to great success. Chronologically,
      Aurora is the third Disney Princess. Actress Elle Fanning portrayed a
      live-action version of Aurora in the film Maleficent (2014), a retelling
      of the 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty from the perspective of the
      title character. Fanning returned to portray Aurora in Maleficent:
      Mistress of Evil (2019), which is set five years later.
    </p>

      The Sleeping Beauty Castle is an attraction at Disneyland. Le Château de
      la Belle au Bois Dormant (French for "The Castle of the Beauty in the
      Sleeping Forest", but known more roughly in English as "Sleeping Beauty
      Castle") was built at Disneyland Paris. The castle was replaced by the
      Castle of Magical Dreams in Hong Kong Disneyland; however, the new castle

      <b>Anna</b> of Arendelle is a fictional character who appears in Walt
      Disney Animation Studios' computer-animated fantasy film Frozen (2013) and
      its sequel Frozen II (2019). She is voiced by Kristen Bell as an adult. At
      the beginning of the film, Livvy Stubenrauch and Katie Lopez provide her
      speaking and singing voice as a young child, respectively. Agatha Lee Monn
      portrayed her as a nine-year-old (singing). In Frozen II, Hadley Gannaway
      provided her voice as a young child while Stubenrauch is the archive
      audio.

      Created by co-writers and directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, Anna is
      loosely based on Gerda, a character from the Danish fairytale "The Snow
      Queen" by Hans Christian Andersen. In the Disney film adaptation, Anna is
      depicted as the princess of Arendelle, a fictional Scandinavian kingdom,
      and the younger sister of Elsa (Idina Menzel), who is the heiress to the
      throne and possesses the elemental ability to create and control ice and
      snow. When Elsa exiles herself from the kingdom after inadvertently
      sending Arendelle into an eternal winter on the evening of her coronation,
      Anna goes on a dangerous adventure and brings her sister back.

      The original fairytale in general and the character of the Snow Queen in
      particular posed long-term problems to adapt into a feature-length
      production. Several film executives, including Walt Disney, made their
      attempts towards the story and numerous adaptations were shelved as the
      filmmakers could not work out the characters. Finally, directors Buck and
      Lee solved the issue by portraying Anna and Elsa as sisters, establishing
      a dynamic relationship between the characters.

      Film critics praised Anna's determination and enthusiasm in her
      personality and Bell for her performance in the films.
