      <h2>Iron Man</h2>
      <p>
        Iron Man is a businessman and an entrepreneur who constantly seeks to
        innovate and improve his technology.[79] Stan Lee modeled Iron Man after
        businessman Howard Hughes.[80][79] The character shares many traits with
        Hughes, including a similar business, his reputation as an arrogant
        playboy, and a physical resemblance.[79] As a businessman, Tony Stark is
        motivated to create and develop technology both for personal benefit and
        for the benefit of society.[81][82] His belief in progress sometimes
        manifests as opposition to the press and politicians, whose attempts to
        keep him accountable hamper his efforts as a superhero.[83] Iron Man was
        created at a time when comic book characters were first depicted
        struggling with real life problems, and his heart injury was an early
        example of a superhero with a physical disability.[84] This injury was
        prominent in his early characterization, making him misanthropic so as not
        to reveal the nature of his injury or his secret identity,[8] thereby
        threatening his autonomy and his masculinity.[85] As real world medical
        technology made heart injuries less fatal, Iron Man's physical maladies
        extended to neurological damage.[86] Iron Man was given a mental illness
        as well when he was written as an alcoholic.[87]
