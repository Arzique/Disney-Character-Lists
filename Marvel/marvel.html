    <h1>Iron Man</h1>
    <p>
      Iron Man is a businessman and an entrepreneur who constantly seeks to
      innovate and improve his technology.[79] Stan Lee modeled Iron Man after
      businessman Howard Hughes.[80][79] The character shares many traits with
      Hughes, including a similar business, his reputation as an arrogant
      playboy, and a physical resemblance.[79] As a businessman, Tony Stark is
      motivated to create and develop technology both for personal benefit and
      for the benefit of society.[81][82] His belief in progress sometimes
      manifests as opposition to the press and politicians, whose attempts to
      keep him accountable hamper his efforts as a superhero.[83] Iron Man was
      created at a time when comic book characters were first depicted
      struggling with real life problems, and his heart injury was an early
      example of a superhero with a physical disability.[84] This injury was
      prominent in his early characterization, making him misanthropic so as not
      to reveal the nature of his injury or his secret identity,[8] thereby
      threatening his autonomy and his masculinity.[85] As real world medical
      technology made heart injuries less fatal, Iron Man's physical maladies
      extended to neurological damage.[86] Iron Man was given a mental illness
      as well when he was written as an alcoholic.[87]
